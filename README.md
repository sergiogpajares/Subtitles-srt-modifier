# About
This code is a quick implementation of a little parser to modify srt files in order to sync text with your video. This code has been tested to work with **Python 3**

# Disclaimer
There are some **final modifications** that has not be implemented yet. So, the code may not work as expected in some cases. Also, **UI is not been implemented**. When you want to enter the .srt file you want to modify you must find the section 'MAIN DATA' at the code. Then, modify the var named 'path' with the path to your file and execute the program.
